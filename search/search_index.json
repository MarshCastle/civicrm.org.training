You will find sections for sessions, courses and handouts. Each session covers a discrete topic, and includes aims, learning points, a session plan and exercises. Most sessions also have a corresponding handout in the handouts section. The courses suggest how sessions may be compiled to create training that runs over a longer period of time (maybe one or two days), and which may be around a specific topic, such as memberships. The sessions and courses can be run with groups of learners and the trainer will need access to a CiviCRM installation, which is loaded with the standard sample data, a projector and a suitable venue. If you would like the learners to complete the supplied exercises the trainer will also have to ensure that each learner can access their own CiviCRM installation loaded with sample data. Editing this guide This guide is made with MkDocs and stored in a GitHub repository . For simple editing instructions, see contributing to this guide . For a more in-depth editing tutorial, see our page in the Developer Guide on writing documentation . The hope is that trainers will add new course programmes to the guide, as and when they have devised and delivered them. Credits This guide is collaboratively written by the CiviCRM community, with facilitation from the Documentation Working Group . It draws heavily on training material written by Michael McAndrew and Oliver Gibson.","title":"CiviCRM Training Guide"},{"location":"#civicrm-training-guide","text":"","title":"CiviCRM Training Guide"},{"location":"#scope-of-this-guide","text":"This guide is aimed at CiviCRM trainers who train users, system administrators and developers who would like to learn more about configuring and using CiviCRM.

Day 1 intro Icebreakers. Some ideas: Get attendees to interview each other in pairs. Tell them they'll report back to the group on their partner. They should report back on their name, organisation, what they do there, how they are using CiviCRM, and what they want out of the training. Get everyone to introduce themselves - name, organisation, one thing they are finding challenging, and one thing they are excited about. Structure of training 5 sessions each day - each is 1 hour long 1 hour of extra time at the end of the day Sessions format is generally presentations and discussion, followed by exercises, followed by recap of the session Tell them you will be starting with the basics, and get more advanced later on Ask if any learners want to do a presentation at some point on how they are using CiviCRM. Having one of these on each day is great. Exercises People might not have time to do all of the exercises - encourage them to use the handout to have a go at a later date Ask them to give any feedback they have on the exercises. Questions Encourage people to ask questions at any point Remind them also to respect everyone's time - it may be a diverse group, and you don't want a long series of questions on a very specific use case.

CiviCRM is web-based software used by a diverse range of organisations, particularly not-for-profit organizations (nonprofits and civic sector organizations). CiviCRM offers a complete feature set out of the box and can integrate with your website. CiviCRM is created and used by a global community of tens of thousands of individuals and organisations. Our vision is that 'all organisations \u2013 regardless of their size, budget, or focus \u2013 have access to an amazing CRM to engage their contacts and achieve their missions'. Our roadmap outlines the shorter term goals we are implementing to acheive our vision. Information and Support There is an excellent, community maintained, User Guide available in the official CiviCRM documentation (https://docs.civicrm.org/). If you can't find what you need in there - there is a Stack Exchange site where you may find just the answer you are looking for. There's a search bo x there - you may find it very beneficial to open an account there - so you can be notified when there are answers to questions that you show an interest in (https://civicrm.stackexchange.com/). If you find something broken in CiviCRM, you can report it to the GitLab issue queue, although this is not such a straightforward task. The CiviCRM GitLab instance is here: https://lab.civicrm.org/infrastructure Exercises Your user account and contact record Find the contact associated with your user (admin) and add your details to that contact record. Contacts, activities and relationships Create a record for a co-worker and your employer in your CiviCRM. For each contact, make sure to include: email phone number postal address Schedule a meeting with your co-worker for this time next week. Add the activities dashlet to your dashboard. Can you see your meeting in this dashlet? Cancel the meeting (don't delete it, just cancel it). What happens to your activities dashlet? Have a look at the co-worker record you created above. Is their employer recorded? If not, record their employer now. Your co worker volunteered with another organisation from 2009 to 2011 - create the new organisation and record this as a relationship. Have a look at your co-workers relationship tab to check that their relationships are up to date Groups and tags How many people are in the newsletter subscribers group? Create mailing labels for the newsletter on Avery L7160 label paper. How many labels did it produce? Is this different to the amount of people in the group, and if so, why? You just chatted with your co-worker and they are interested in helping out more. Create a new group call 'Active volunteers' and add them to this group. Find all contacts with the 'Volunteers' tag and add them to the 'Active volunteers' group (note that you don't have to add them one at a time). Since you now have both a tag and a group referring to volunteers, to avoid confusion, it probably makes sense to delete the 'Volunteers' tag. Smart groups Find all people who were 'no-shows' for any of the events you have run and create a new Smart group for these people called 'no shows'. Have a look at the members of the smart group. On your event dashboard, find a contact that was registered for an event and change their status to 'no show'. Now have a look at your 'no shows' smart group - what do you notice?

Objectives Specific objectives: Understand how to configure Financial Accounts, Financial Types, and the Relations between them Understand how to manage and export Accounting Batches Understand a safe process for initial imports of Accounting Batches into accounting packages like QuickBooks Learning Points You should aim to cover: What Financial Account Type, Account Code, and Account Type Code are used for and how they relate to your Chart of Accounts What the point of Financial Types is, and how to Assign Financial Accounts to them Creating, Editing, Closing and Exporting Accounting Batches Typical issues when first importing batches into QuickBooks and similar packages Session Plan The session should last 60 minutes. Basic Concepts (10 minutes) Review the basic ideas of double entry accounting: Organizations have a Chart of Accounts in their bookkeeping system, with different accounts classed as Assets, Liabilities, Revenue, Expenses, and so on. A donation creates a balancing entry in both revenue account and an asset account like Payment Processor account (or Cash and Cheques for Deposit). A pay later transaction creates an entry in both revenue account and accounts receivable (assuming accrual accounting). A payment for a pay later transaction creates an entry that reduces accounts receivable and increases an asset account like a Bank Account. Present how financial types can hide this complexity from staff who are not trained in bookkeeping or accounting: The lifecycle of a particular kind of revenue almost always deals with a predetermined set of accounts. Andrew Perry of Community Builders proposed that we use this to simplify use of the system by investing more effort in initial configuration of 'financial types' that bundle related financial accounts together. We still need to configure the financial account associated with online payment processors separately from the rest of the financial accounts in a financial type. Outline how financial batches are used: Batching transactions is a best practice for handling financial transactions. Batching provides a convenient way to ensure audit-ability, and corresponds to actions like depositing a set of cheques. Explain the process of closing batches, reconciling them, and then exporting them. Note that closed batches can be re-opened and adjusted, but exported batches cannot be changed. Additional change transactions can be created to adjust errors in an exported batch. Configuration of Financial Accounts and Financial Types (10 minutes) Demonstrate how to export a Chart of Accounts from QuickBooks and view it in a low-level editor. Point out Account Code, Account Name, and Account Type. Show how to view the list of existing financial accounts at Administer CiviContribute Financial Accounts.

Objectives Specific objectives: Understand the principles behind CiviCase and under what circumstances it can be used Understand how to configure the CiviCase settings Understand the CiviCase interface. Learning points You should aim to cover the following points in this session: What a case is How to add a new case type How to add new cases and to manage a case. Extra points that it would be good to go into, if there is time include: Case reports Session Plan This session should last 30 minutes and there are no exercises. Basic concepts (15 minutes) Give the group a basic understanding as to what a case is. That; A collection of activities make up a single case A set workflow can be applied to a case (a workflow being a number of set sequenced activities called a Timeline) It is often used where various staff members (or external agencies) need to be involved in a single case. Ask the group to give example case types and discuss these. A good simple example is a medical one - 'open case', 'see doctor', ' approved for physiotherapy', 'attend physiotherapy sessions', 'close case'. Or a Housing case type. Go to the Case dashboard and look at each of the screen elements. You should then create a new case of type Housing Support, show the status and look at the activities that appear in the timeline. It is important to make it clear that the timeline doesn't have to be fixed and then you can add other activities to the case. Explain the Case Roles and highlight how the existing contact relationships and case resources also appear on the case screen. Case resources are available to all cases of a given case type. Search for some cases and show the learners how you can use find activities to look for specific case activities (e.g. Search for open case activities only). Adding a new case type / Case configuration (15 minutes) Explain that setting up a new case type requires careful consideration. Navigate to Administer- CiviCase- CaseTypes. The screen lists available activity types including the maximum number of instances of an activity within a case (e.g. open case should have a maximum instance of 1) To add new activity types to a case which don't already exist in CiviCRM, you will need to create new activity types first via the administration menu. If you are adding a Timeline you will need to identify the activities which are included in the timeline and the number of days between each activity (called the offset) Sequences are similar to timelines but are not constrained by time, but are tasks which have to occur in the defined order Determine who will be involved in the case (the case roles). These relationships will have to be added to the Administration / Relationship Types list first.

If you are adding a Timeline you will need to identify the activities which are included in the timeline and the number of days between each activity (called the offset) Sequences are similar to timelines but are not constrained by time, but are tasks which have to occur in the defined order Determine who will be involved in the case (the case roles). These relationships will have to be added to the Administration / Relationship Types list first.","title":"Adding a new case type / Case configuration (15 minutes)"},{"location":"sessions/case-management/#more-useful-tools-for-case-management","text":"Explain that the CiviCRM book contains more detail on case management.

Objectives Have an overview of the different tools that you can use for communication in CiviCRM, and the requirements of each (e.g. any necessary system configuration or third party providers). Understand how to create and send personalised mass mailings, and how to track the effectiveness of these mailings. Understand CiviCRM's email templating system. Be able to carry out two way communication via SMS. Understand how to create scheduled mailings based on events or memberships Learning points Initial configuration should be done by a systems administrator. This session covers: How to use of Groups for newsletter subscriptions, and self-serve subscription management. Impact of using search results instead of groups, or groups named for internal purposes. How to construct the parts of a personalized mass email and send it. How to send an SMS message. How to schedule reminder emails. How to save email sent from Outlook and gmail into CiviCRM. Session Plan This session aims to take 60 minutes. It includes some front of the class demonstrations (that can be carried out using the CiviCRM that was used to run the training course). Since this session is about sending live email, it is probably worth 1) ensuring that live email can be sent from the environment that you are using, and 2) reinforcing the fact with students that live email will be sent. Overview (5) Outline the three big parts of CiviCRM that we'll be looking at during this session. We'll start with CiviMail and with a bit of luck we'll have time to cover Scheduled reminders and SMS. CiviMail Scheduled reminders SMS Mention that there are also other parts of CiviCRM where email gets sent (e.g. confirmation receipts, Send Email action on a Contact Dashboard, the Send Email action on a Search Results page) but they are simple and we won't be talking much about them. Email system configuration Setting up email is a system administrator task Configuring mail server - something you will want to get a pro to do or use a third party service. Mass mailing / CiviMail Mass or bulk emailing is also known by other terms, like sending newsletters or sending a mail blast, etc. It makes sense to split this in two into mailing list management (covered in some exercises) and creating and sending newsletters Mailing list management (5) There are two key points to get across here: 1) Groups are the main tool for mailing list management. These can be smart groups (e.g. meet up attendees). Ask the class for examples of smart groups that would make sense as mailing lists. Make sure the final list contains: members people that have attended an event people that have contributed more than a certain amount. Show them the manage groups page where you can create and edit groups: /civicrm/group Show them that some but not all groups are mailing lists (so if you are wondering why your group is not showing up, it is probably because it is not a mailing list). 2) CiviCRM allows people to control their own subscription to groups. Show people the following page: /civicrm/mailing/subscribe and how this relates to /civicrm/group Explain difference between unsubscribe (removed from group) and opt out. Indicate that people who have opted out have their On hold status set true as though the email is invalid. Explain options for unsubscribe: links in each email their contact dashboard. Creating newsletters (15) Demonstrate how to create a mailing by walking through the CiviMail wizard on civicrm.org and creating a mailing to the people that have registered to attend this training and to the trainers. A few key points to make sure that you get across: Mailings start with groups (might help to create a group and add the students to that group first) Mailings can exclude previous mailings Mailings use templates, headers and footers Mailings use tokens Mailings should be tested litmus - quite expensive - good for layout testing in different browsers http://www.mail-tester.com/ - cheaper and quite effective for spam, at least Mailings can be scheduled Mailings must include an opt out or unsubscribe. Make sure that you include in the email: external links for tracking an image that they will have to download images to see a token that is replaced by their name a checksum link to a profile form. The link detail is http://www.organisation.org/civicrm/profile/edit?reset=1 gid=N id={contact.contact_id} {contact.checksum} where N is the ID of the profile form you want them to edit. The special link lasts for 7 days from the day you send the mailing (in Drupal / Joomla sites). Tokens and checksums Talk about out of the box tokens and the fact that you can create custom tokens. Explain what checksums are and get people to think about when they would be useful. Make sure the final list includes: non-logged-in users updating details in a profile form going to contribution / membership pages with details pre-filled Discuss downsides of using checksums, and ask group about possible problems. Make sure they come up with problem of forwarded email leading to privacy breach and overwriting of data. Discuss with the group how useful this feature is in terms of being to keep contact data up to date. Once your email is complete, send the mail. Have people open the email and click on the links so that you can show them tracking info. Scheduled reminders (5) Scheduled reminders are very useful. Can be based on events, memberships, activities, a date field for a contact. Get people to come up with times at which you might want to use scheduled reminders. Make sure that the final list includes: before and after events with reminders / solicitations for feedback as people approach the end of their memberships (membership renewals) as reminder for staff to carry out activities (e.g. the day before they are due) a contact's birthday Individual emails into and out of CiviCRM (5) Show the other simple way that email can be sent from CiviCRM. Explain the difference between that and CiviMail (no tracking, only a few contacts). Auto-filing email conversations in CiviCRM with bcc. Communication exercises (10) Get people to carry out the scheduled reminders exercises. SMS (5) Sending an SMS is similar to sending an email apart from two things (get the class to think about what these might be): no formatting replying is quite easy for SMS To work with SMS, you need an SMS provider.

Objectives Become familiar with basic financial concepts in CiviCRM (including payment processors), be comfortable creating and working with online contribution pages, and be comfortable carrying out back end contribution administration and reporting. Learning points Things to learn: Basic CiviContribute concepts (contributions, financial types, custom data) Relationship of CiviContribute to other parts of CiviCRM (e.g. contacts, memberships and events) Contribution pages Payment processors Campaign widgets Premiums Personal campaign pages Sales tax and invoicing Back end contribution admin (including the contribution dashboard, creating and editing contributions, and bulk entry of offline contributions). Session Plan This session should take 60 minutes. Explain that we'll cover the basics and that you can go into more depth using the book if you want to. Basic concepts (10) Explain that contributions are the basic financial building block of CiviCRM, and that any financial transaction in CiviCRM (whether a donation, membership fee, etc.) is accompanied by a contribution. Contributions are similar to other CiviCRM entities like contacts. Ask learners if they can think about how they might be similar. A final list of qualities of contributions should contain: CiviCRM comes with out of the box contribution types you can add more types of contribution (these can relate to accounting codes) you can attach custom data to contributions (ask them to think of some examples) contributions are always attached to a contact sometimes attached to other entities like participants and memberships Contributions are of a given type which define related financial types (for accounting integration) Contributions can be exported as a spreadsheet, and also in accounting package formats. Contribution pages (10) Explain that contribution pages: are out of the box allow people to donate money to you via your website have some useful features like Profiles Recurring payments Campaign widgets Premiums Personal campaign pages Pledges Show a few examples of real world contribution pages. It's probably helpful to show people some that have been themed, and some that haven't been themed. https://www.eff.org/ and http://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/ have some good examples of themed pages. CiviCRM has a good example of not themed pages. Contribution page exercises (25) Before starting the exercises, it is a good idea to show people what contribution page administration looks like by showing them the manage contribution pages screen. Points to make clear include: you can set up as many as you like configuration happens via the tabs at the top of the screen. You should also explain to them techniques for testing (which include logging out or going into private browsing / incognito mode to test) and what happens if you don't log out for testing. When recapping the exercises, it might be worth noting the different ways that you can create contributions records in the backend (including the menu, the contributions page, the contact actions button). Payment processors (5) Explain that if you want to take transactions on your site you'll need to integrate with a payment processor. Points to make: There are two types of payment processor on your website (SSL required, smoother workflow) on the payment processor's website (easier and cheaper) All payment processors have different pricing schedules You can see the out of the box integrations on the payment processors page Other payment processors are available via extensions. Sales Tax and Invoicing (5) Show people the sales tax and invoicing settings pages (administer CiviContribute CiviContribute component settings) Discuss the page settings (what do you call sales tax, due date and display settings) Then show them how to create the sales tax Account (administer CiviContribute Financial accounts), make sure Financial Account Type is set to Liability. Select Enabled and Is Tax and specify the Tax Rate. After you create the Financial Account, assign it to the specific Financial Type (adminster CiviContribute Financial Types). Find the Financial Type this sales tax applies to, and click on Accounts. Click on Assign Account. Once a sales tax Financial Account has been added, you will see it listed with the other Financial Accounts for that specific Financial Type. Personal campaign pages (5) Can be configured from the contribution page admin screens allow you to set up justgiving style pages attached to a contribution page.","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"sessions/contribute/#contribute","text":"handout","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"sessions/contribute/#aim","text":"By the end of the session, you should be able to manage contribution and contribution pages.","title":"Aim"},{"location":"sessions/contribute/#objectives","text":"Become familiar with basic financial concepts in CiviCRM (including payment processors), be comfortable creating and working with online contribution pages, and be comfortable carrying out back end contribution administration and reporting.","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"sessions/contribute/#learning-points","text":"Things to learn: Basic CiviContribute concepts (contributions, financial types, custom data) Relationship of CiviContribute to other parts of CiviCRM (e.g. contacts, memberships and events) Contribution pages Payment processors Campaign widgets Premiums Personal campaign pages Sales tax and invoicing Back end contribution admin (including the contribution dashboard, creating and editing contributions, and bulk entry of offline contributions).","title":"Learning points"},{"location":"sessions/contribute/#session-plan","text":"This session should take 60 minutes.

Basic concepts (10 minutes) With the group talk about what duplicates are and ask the group why they may occur (e.g. from imported data, public form data, added by staff, misspellings). Show the group the Find and Merge Duplicate Contacts page and at this stage explain the difference between the Supervised, Unsupervised and General rule types. Unsupervised rules are used when new contacts are created through online registration forms including event, membership, contribution, and profile pages (and when you create a contact through CiviCRM's programming API). Unsupervised rules place a priority on avoiding false matches and apply relatively rigid criteria. It is therefore possible to sometimes miss real duplicates. Supervised rules are used to check for duplicates when contacts are added or edited via the CiviCRM user interface and a human has to decide if the match is accurate. Supervised rules have a looser definition of matches so you can catch as many possible duplicates as possible. Demonstrate to the group how a Supervised rule is used when you try to save a duplicate organisation and what your options are. Explain to the group that when you import data you can choose which of the available rules you would like to use. Configuring Rules (10 minutes) Go back to the Find and Merge Duplicate Contacts page and edit the Organization Unsupervised rule. Go through in detail the concepts of: Adding fields (add some more fields) The meaning of weight and weight threshold How length will affect the matching result. A good example is 'On a First Name field check with a length of 2 Jo and Joanne would be matched'. Add a new rule that will identify individuals who have the same Postal Code and Birth Date. Merging Contacts (10 minutes) Run the Organization Unsupervised rule and explain the whole process of contact merging. Not forgetting; To explain the implications of running a Batch dedupe What dedupe exceptions are The difference between the duplicate and the original on the merge screen What actually happens when you merge the contacts Exercise 1 (15 minutes) You can now ask the learners to complete Exercise 1.

Explain that we'll be building on what we learnt in the first session about contacts activities relationships tags and groups That we are going to go into more detail on groups and tags relationships types custom data Groups vs. tags (10) People tend to get quite hung up on the difference between groups and tags, and everyone has their own way of using them. Ask if there are any examples from the audience. It is worthwhile giving a few pointers here. Here are some suggestions: There is quite a lot of overlap between tags and groups There are some things that groups can do that tags can't, and visa versa (see handout for details) You'll learn from experience when to use one and not the other. You can reasonably easily change from a group to a tag and visa versa (select all contacts with a tag, and add them to a group) Take questions from the learners on their use cases. Relationships (5) Get people to brainstorm some different relationship types that are possible between contacts and write these on a board. Where appropriate, write the two different words for the relationship. You should end up with something like parent/child friend employer/employee subsidiary Once they are on the board, ask people to think about what contact types go with different relationship types so you end up with something like individual -- parent/child -- individual individual -- friend -- individual individual -- employer/employee -- individual organisation -- subsidiary -- organisation Explain that you can add extra relationship types to represent different relations in your organisation. Custom data (10) Ask people what they would do if they wanted to store some extra information about a contact in CiviCRM, for example some extra information about potential funding organisations, like: the funders interests the amount of funding that the funder normally gives when the funding deadlines are Probably a good idea to explain the following by drawing some diagrams ... Explain that this would be a good time to use custom data. Some points to get across: nearly all of the records in CiviCRM (e.g. contacts, activities, relationships, groups, etc.) can be extended with custom data fields. If you want to only add data to a certain type of object, you can do so. For example if you only wanted to add funding information to 'funders', you can make a new type of organisation called 'funder' and add the fields there. (Probably a good idea to explain this via drawing on a board.) remember that custom data is only one way to model data in CiviCRM. Often the right approach but consider other approaches as well (groups, tags, and other built in entities) Probably a good idea to explain the following by going through the user interface... Explain that there are two steps to adding custom data. Choose the object that you want to add the custom data to, and add a custom data set to that object (or specific type of object) Add custom data fields to that set Explain that each field has a type. Help learners understand the the different types of custom data fields that exist by asking them what field types they would use for the data above. Organising data exercises (20) At this point, learners should do the organising data exercises. 5 minutes before the end of this session, ask someone who has completed the exercise if they would like to demonstrate their custom data set in use. If no one is willing to do so, then ask if you can demonsrate it for them and ask them questions about why they chose certain fields.

Without the exercises, you should be able to complete it in 30 minutes. Demonstrate to the learners how profiles work and then ask the learners to complete the exercises Basic concepts (15 minutes) Explain to the the group that profiles are a collection of fields that are used to gather or display information. Profiles are either user defined or reserved by the system and each one can be used multiple times. Explain that they are used to collect new/edit existing data and are used to expose data. As a group discuss who might use profiles (e.g. staff, volunteers, directory users, logged in site users, members, site visitors completing a form, event participants). Go through the following data collection / existing data uses Such as new contacts - show the learners the reserved / new Individual profile create form Explain why the system uses reserved profiles and that you can still edit some elements of some reserved profiles Used to register site users and edit existing Drupal user account details - explain what this means Used for standalone data collection forms. Explain who might use these e.g. Volunteers adding form data Used for the batch updating of multiple contacts Used within Contribution and Event Registration forms Go through the following exposing data uses Like a Searchable directory To show alternative search result views Creating Profiles (15 minutes) Create a new sample Profile and spend some time discussing with the group the meaning of all the Advanced options.
